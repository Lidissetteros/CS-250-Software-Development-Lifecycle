Welcome to the CS250 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) portfolio repository. This space will allow my instructors to find work done for this course as well as all reflections, Agile documentation, and key deliverables for the course work.

This repository demonstrates how I used the core principles of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) such as; Scrum and Agile methodologies, iterative development, user stories, retrospective analysis of the process, etc. in real-life scenarios and as part of my Group Projects.


Contents of This Repository Include

- Agile artifacts (User stories, Acceptance Criteria, Retrospectives, Team Roles)

- Documentation from sprint processes completed, following the Scrum methodology

- Written reflections on Agile and Waterfall development

- Journals and Milestone submissions from the course

- Project files showing my understanding of the SDLC and how to work with them
