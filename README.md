# CS-250-Software-Development-Lifecycle

Welcome to the CS250 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) portfolio repository. This space will allow my instructors to find work done for this course as well as all reflections, Agile documentation, and key deliverables for the course work.

This repository demonstrates how I used the core principles of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) such as; Scrum and Agile methodologies, iterative development, user stories, retrospective analysis of the process, etc. in real-life scenarios and as part of my Group Projects.


Contents of This Repository Include

- Agile artifacts (User stories, Acceptance Criteria, Retrospectives, Team Roles)

- Documentation from sprint processes completed, following the Scrum methodology

- Written reflections on Agile and Waterfall development

- Journals and Milestone submissions from the course

- Project files showing my understanding of the SDLC and how to work with them

  

About Me

My name is Lidissette Rosario and I am a software development student at Southern New Hampshire University. I am enhancing my skill set in Agile workflows, backend and frontend programming, and real-life IT project-based development.

This portfolio represents my growth towards:

- Agile and Scrum Methodologies

- Software development

- Collaborative teamwork

- Iterative improvement

- Communication between members of the development team.

  

Reflection

Reflecting back on my experiences in this class has provided me with a much better appreciation of the importance of identifying and understanding the needs of users. This process is much more than finding out what the user would like and then building it. It involves looking into the user’s environment, their objectives, and their reasoning for every functional element to be developed. User stories facilitated this process as they encouraged me to view the project from a user’s perspective as opposed to focusing on technical details. Acceptance criteria helped to clarify what construction was completed by providing me with an objective yardstick to determine when something had been constructed with the least amount of assumption and therefore would have the same interpretation by the development team as the user intended. 

My philosophy on how to approach development has changed as a result of this course. I have always been a planner and thought of development as a process in which everything has to be perfectly planned from the beginning, with no possibility for change once development began. Working through the sprints showed me how valuable it is to break work into manageable pieces, adapt when new information becomes available, and communicate regularly with the team. This structure made the workload feel more organized and far less overwhelming, and it reflected a more realistic way to handle evolving requirements. Even though I’m not working in an Agile environment yet, these  are the practices I plan to bring into future development work because they create clarity, reduce stress, and support steady progress. 

In addition, one of the most important things I learned from this class is how to work effectively as part of a team when developing software. An effective software developer works as a part of a team, writing code, but also demonstrating reliability and the ability to communicate openly. They also demonstrate an ability to help other team members when problems arise. A team that experiences success throughout the life cycle of a software project will be able to share knowledge and experience, prioritize the work, and feel comfortable asking questions and expressing concerns to one another. This class demonstrated how critical the ability to collaborate with one another is in addition to having the right technical skills when developing software for users.
